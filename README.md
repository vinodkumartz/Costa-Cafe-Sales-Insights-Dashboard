##  Project Goals

This analytical solution focuses on:
-  Querying structured sales data from a relational database.
-  Designing visually intuitive dashboards with Power BI.
-  Understanding which products and timeframes yield the highest sales.
-  Investigating pricing impact and promotional efficiency.
-  Recommending data-driven improvements for sales growth.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset used covers a range of transactional and product-related attributes, including:
- `Transaction ID`: Unique identifier for each sale.
- `Date & Time`: Timestamp of each transaction.
- `Quantity`: Units sold.
- `Store Info`: Store ID and physical location.
- `Product Info`: Product name, category, and type.
- `Unit Price`: Selling price per item.

##  Tools Used

- **MySQL** – Data querying, aggregation, and preprocessing.
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and reporting visuals.
- **Microsoft Excel** (preprocessing support for small fixes and previews).

##  Approach & Techniques

###  SQL-Based Data Processing
- Cleaned and validated raw data with SQL queries.
- Generated summaries and aggregated results (e.g., monthly revenue, daily trends).
- Derived custom KPIs for visual storytelling.

###  Power BI Dashboard Design
- Integrated SQL output into Power BI for interactive reporting.
- Designed slicers and filters for month-wise and product-wise navigation.
- Implemented advanced visuals like calendar heat maps, stacked bar charts, and multi-line graphs.

##  Key Dashboards and Visuals

1. **Calendar Heat Map**  
   > Shows daily sales performance using dynamic shading and tooltips for exact metrics.

2. **Weekday vs Weekend Analysis**  
   > Compares buying behavior across weekdays and weekends to optimize staffing and promotions.

3. **Store-wise Sales Performance**  
   > Highlights performance differences across store locations with month-on-month (MoM) trends.

4. **Daily Trendline with Averages**  
   > Visualizes sales each day of the month alongside the average line for quick anomaly detection.

5. **Product Category Breakdown**  
   > Analyzes performance of categories like Beverages, Snacks, and Pastries.

6. **Top 10 Selling Products**  
   > Displays the best-performing items based on sales volume or revenue.

7. **Hourly & Daily Heatmap**  
   > Provides a 2D time grid of sales performance across hours and days for peak time identification.

##  Metrics Tracked

-  **Total Revenue & Monthly Growth**
-  **Order Volume & Frequency**
-  **Quantity Sold Trends**
-  **Store Location Impact**

## üìà Project Overview

The Costa Cafe Sales Project is a data analytics initiative that aims to:
- üìä Extract and manipulate sales data using SQL.
- üìä Create interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI.
- üéØ Identify top-selling products and peak sales periods.
- üéØ Understand the impact of pricing and promotions on sales performance.
- üìù Provide actionable recommendations to enhance sales and customer satisfaction.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Description

The dataset includes comprehensive sales transaction data with key information such as:
- **Transaction ID**: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Transaction Date**: The date on which the transaction occurred.
- **Transaction Time**: The specific time of the transaction.
- **Quantity Sold**: The number of units sold in each transaction.
- **Store ID**: Identifier for the store location.
- **Store Location**: The geographical location of the store.
- **Product ID**: Identifier for the specific product sold.
- **Product Category**: The category of the product (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Pastries).
- **Product Type**: Detailed type of product sold.
- **Unit Price**: The price per unit of the product sold.

## üîß Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: For querying, data extraction, and manipulation from the database.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization, dashboard creation, and reporting.
- **Excel** (Optional): For initial data exploration or verification before loading into Power BI.

## üîç Methodology

### Data Extraction (SQL)
- Use SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database.
- Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values and correcting data inconsistencies.

### Data Analysis (SQL)
- Execute SQL queries to compute key metrics like total sales, average transaction value, and product performance.
- Analyze time-based trends by aggregating sales data by day, week, month, and year.
- Segment customers based on purchase behavior to identify key customer groups.

### Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Import the cleaned and processed data into Power BI.
- Create interactive dashboards showcasing key metrics such as sales trends, top products, and store performance.
- Visualize correlations between product categories, pricing, and sales volume.

## üéØ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Sales Analysis**:
   - Calculate the total sales for each respective month.
   - Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in sales.
   - Calculate the difference in sales between the selected month and the previous month.

2. **Total Orders Analysis**:
   - Calculate the total number of orders for each respective month.
   - Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in the number of orders.
   - Calculate the difference in the number of orders between the selected month and the previous month.

3. **Total Quantity Sold Analysis**:
   - Calculate the total quantity sold for each respective month.
   - Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in the total quantity sold.
   - Calculate the difference in the total quantity sold between the selected month and the previous month.

## üìä Charts Requirements

1. **Calendar Heat Map**:
   - Implement a calendar heat map that dynamically adjusts based on the selected month from a slicer.
   - Color-code each day on the calendar to represent sales volume, with darker shades indicating higher sales.
   - Implement tooltips to display detailed metrics (Sales, Orders, Quantity) when hovering over a specific day.

2. **Sales Analysis by Weekdays and Weekends**:
   - Segment sales data into weekdays and weekends to analyze performance variations.
   - Provide insights into whether sales patterns differ significantly between weekdays and weekends.

3. **Sales Analysis by Store Location**:
   - Visualize sales data by different store locations.
   - Include month-over-month (MoM) difference metrics based on the selected month in the slicer.
   - Highlight MoM sales increase or decrease for each store location to identify trends.

4. **Daily Sales Analysis with Average Line**:
   - Display daily sales for the selected month with a line chart.
   - Incorporate an average line on the chart to represent the average daily sales.
   - Highlight bars exceeding or falling below the average sales to identify exceptional sales days.

5. **Sales Analysis by Product Category**:
   - Analyze sales performance across different product categories.
   - Provide insights into which product category is performing the best.

6. **Top 10 Products by Sales**:
   - Identify and display the top 10 products based on sales volume.
   - Allow users to quickly visualize the best-performing products in terms of sales.

7. **Sales Analysis by Days and Hours**:
   - Utilize a heat map to visualize sales patterns by days and hours.
   - Implement tooltips to display detailed metrics (Sales, Orders, Quantity) when hovering over a specific day-hour.

## üìä Results and Insights

- Identification of high-performing products and categories driving the majority of sales.
- Visualization of sales trends, highlighting peak periods and seasonal variations.
- Analysis of the impact of pricing on sales volume, with recommendations for price adjustments.
- Insights into store performance, identifying locations with the highest and lowest sales.

## üèÅ Conclusion

The Costa Cafe Sales Project successfully leverages SQL and Power BI to deliver in-depth analysis and interactive visualizations of sales data. The findings from this project provide valuable insights into product performance, customer preferences, and sales trends, enabling Costa Cafe to make data-driven decisions that enhance business outcomes.
